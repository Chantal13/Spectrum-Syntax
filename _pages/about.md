Hi!

This site is my working notebook—a place to collect what I’m learning and make it useful for the next curious person who stumbles in. Lately that’s mostly rockhounding: Ontario shorelines, glacial deposits, and the Canadian Shield. I write practical notes on where certain rocks show up, how to identify them in the field, and how to handle them responsibly. While the examples lean Ontario, the methods should travel well anywhere.

I also tinker with Python: small scripts, data clean-ups, and little tools that scratch an itch. Expect concise how-tos, snippets I want to remember, and the occasional explanation written the way I wish I’d first read it.

Outside the keyboard and rock bag, I’m an aviation nerd, a casual guitarist, and a collector of side quests. The site will wander with me—some field notes, some code, and, for now, a very modest blog. If you find an error or have a tip, I’m always happy to learn.
