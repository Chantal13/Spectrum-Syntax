# Air Canada Strike

![[2025-08-18-NofAir Canada.png]]

Air Canada’s 10,000 flight attendants, represented by CUPE, have been without a collective agreement since March 31, 2024, when their previous contract expired. Negotiations for a new agreement began in late 2023 but stalled after nine months of what CUPE describes as stonewalling by the airline. During this time, flight attendants—who are only paid once the aircraft doors are closed—continued to face poverty wages and unpaid hours, while Air Canada reported billions in profit. With no progress at the bargaining table and members having already waited more than a year without a contract, flight attendants voted overwhelmingly to strike with a **99% strike mandate**, setting the stage for the current work stoppage.

> [!summary] Air Canada Flight Attendants – At a Glance
> - **Expired contract**: Flight attendants have been without a collective agreement since **March 31, 2024**.  
> - **Unpaid hours**: They are only paid once aircraft doors close, leaving large amounts of unpaid work time.  
> - **Strike action**: After months of stalled bargaining, flight attendants voted 99%+ in favour of a strike, which began on **August 16, 2025**.  
> - **Government intervention**: Ottawa invoked **Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code** the same day to order a return to work and binding arbitration.  
> - **Union stance**: CUPE has rejected arbitration, pledged to defy the order, and insists only free collective bargaining can resolve the dispute.  

Air Canada flight attendants, represented by CUPE, are only paid once the aircraft doors are closed—so any time they spend boarding, dealing with delays, or standing by at the gate goes unpaid, despite performing essential safety and service work. Mark Hancock, CUPE National President, emphasized that “for those workers, for those flight attendants, they're working those three hours, those four hours, and not getting paid a $dime$. And that's just unforgivable”. When this unpaid labour is factored in, many flight attendants receive effective pay that falls below minimum wage.

> **Air Canada (CEO Michael Rousseau):**  
> *“Our latest proposal would make flight attendants the best compensated in Canada, bar none, with a 40% increase in total compensation over four years.”* [^5]


> **CUPE’s Response:**  
> The union argues the proposal delivers far less in practice—an 8% first-year wage increase that amounts to only 17.2% for many, with half of attendants receiving less[^6]. More importantly, attendants would still not be paid for hours spent on the ground performing safety and service duties before the doors close. CUPE maintains that these unpaid hours undermine Air Canada’s claim of offering the “best paid” jobs in the sector[^6][^5].  


> [!warning] Fact Check  
> Both statements contain elements of truth. Air Canada’s calculation of “best compensated” compares base wage and benefits against industry peers. CUPE’s rebuttal highlights that flight attendants’ effective earnings are reduced by significant unpaid ground time, which is not captured in the company’s figures. The core dispute is whether compensation should reflect **all hours worked**, not just flight time.  


On August 16, 2025, the federal government invoked Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code to order the Canada Industrial Relations Board to impose binding arbitration and to demand that flight attendants resume work, citing economic harm and the need to restore industrial peace. As Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu announced, “I have exercised my authorities under Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code to direct the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order the parties to resume and continue their operations and duties in order to secure industrial peace and protect the interests of Canada, Canadians and the economy”[^2]. The union has strongly rejected both the order and the prospect of binding arbitration, calling it unconstitutional and dismissive of workers’ rights[^4]. 

CUPE National Secretary-Treasurer Candace Rennick stated, “After nine months of Air Canada stonewalling negotiations, the federal government's decision to take away their right to have a say in their future is simply not something that we are able to support in good conscience. We cannot look away while this happens. We cannot, and we will not turn our back on these workers”. Hancock reinforced the union’s commitment, saying, “If it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it. If it means our union being fined, then so be it. We're looking for a solution here. Our members want a solution here, but that solution has to be found at a bargaining table”.

CUPE acknowledges the public impact of the dispute—missed vacations, medical appointments, stranded travelers—and has expressed regret for the hardship caused. Rennick conveyed this empathy: “We deeply, deeply regret the impact that this is having on your families and on your lives. Our fight is not with you”. Despite being ready to negotiate, CUPE reports that Air Canada has not done so—in fact, CUPE reached out on Sunday, August 16, but received no response. Hancock underscored the imbalance: “We're here to negotiate a collective agreement. The employer is not here”. Court proceedings are underway, but Hancock warns that they could take a decade to resolve—“We’re looking at 10 years probably before this works its way through the courts and our members do not have 10 years to wait to have their rights restored”.

This isn’t the only time Section 107 has been invoked. In fact, the federal government has used this extraordinary power on several occasions in the past decade, including:

- **2011 – Air Canada flight attendants**: The Labour Minister referred a dispute to the CIRB after workers twice rejected tentative agreements, raising the prospect of arbitration.[^1]
    
- **2024 – WestJet mechanics**: A Section 107 referral attempted to block a strike but was later found by the CIRB not to suspend the union’s right to withdraw labour.[^1]
    
- **2024 – Rail and port disputes**: Section 107 was used to order an end to work stoppages at Canada’s two major railways and at port operations in Vancouver, Quebec, and Montreal.[^1]
    
- **2024 – Canada Post**: The government delayed a prolonged strike by invoking Section 107 until May of that year.[^1]
    

CUPE argues that Section 107 has been wielded with increasing frequency, too often pre-empting genuine negotiation and sidelining parliamentary scrutiny. As the Canadian Labour Congress president stated in December 2024, “The invocation of Section 107 ... marks the fourth instance just this year in which the government has used this extraordinary power, impacting seven distinct groups of workers whose Charter-protected rights to engage in legal work stoppages have been trampled”[^3].

This dispute is not just about wages; it’s about fair compensation for hours worked, the respect of constitutionally protected labour rights, and the principle that workers—including a predominantly female workforce—must be paid for their time. CUPE remains steadfast in pushing for a negotiated outcome—not imposed arbitration—and will continue fighting for fair treatment both on picket lines and in courts.
