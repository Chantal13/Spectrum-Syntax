# ðŸ§¿ Welcome to Spectrum Syntax!

This site is my working notebookâ€”mostly rockhounding (Ontario-focused but useful anywhere), a bit of Python programming, and, for now, one humble blog post. I like doing lots of different thingsâ€”aviation, guitar, and whatever else catches my curiosityâ€”so expect the topics to wander as I do.

Take a look at my blog <strong>[[Inside My Mind]]</strong> while you are here.

Here is what I am currently interested in:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[[Python]]</strong></li>
    <li><strong>[[rockhounding]]</strong></li>
  </ul>
I also play games like these:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[[IDLE Champions]]</strong></li>
    <li><strong>[[Dark War Survival]]</strong></li>
  </ul>

<strong>Recently updated notes</strong>

<ul>
  {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}
  {% for note in recent_notes limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      {{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ note.url | relative_url | uri_escape }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
