### Cleaning Cycles (Between Stages)
- After each grit stage (1–3), do a **short cleaning run** before moving forward.  
- Use **water + a squirt of dish soap or a spoon of borax**.  
- Run barrel for a few hours up to 1 full day.  
- Plastic or ceramic media may help scrub surfaces.  
- Purpose: remove all leftover grit and slurry, prevent contamination in the next stage.
