title: Inside My Mind
summary: Expect a grab-bag of geeky stuff and whatever currently has my attention—scuba diving, guitar, music, aviation, chess, and assorted rabbit holes. I’ll post notes, tiny experiments, and the occasional how-to when I’ve learned something worth sharing. No strict schedule; just honest curiosity.
