- Summary: Researchers found about 15% lower mGlu5 receptor availability in autistic adults compared to neurotypical adults. Lower mGlu5 levels were linked to altered excitatory activity measured by a shallower EEG power‑spectrum slope. This molecular difference may help explain and stratify autism traits.
