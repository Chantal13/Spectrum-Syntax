- Summary: Glaciers and meltwater reshaped southern Ontario and carved the Great Lakes basins.  
Ancient seas and glaciers left rock, gravel and soil that shape Toronto's land.  
When the ice retreated, changing lakes and rivers formed High Park's ravines and supported rich forests.

- About 13,000 years ago, the ice retreated from the 'Lake Ontario' basin. Much meltwater accumulated, more than at any previous time, so it was given a new name: Lake Iroquois. It was the largest lake yet in that basin. The shore was 4 –15 km away from where it is today. In the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), striking remains can be seen along the Highland Creek, crossing the Rouge Valley, and on the Seaton Trail in Pickering.

    - Note: OMG. Someone actually mentioned Highland Creek.
- That bedrock, also found in Muskoka, Haliburton and south into the US, is the *southern* (Grenville) portion of the Canadian Shield (see Figure 2). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k40dmmn5ww9y4tjysdd9m9ky))
- The warm, shallow waters supported a large variety of life (see Figure 3), including corals, sponges, clams, crinoids (sea-lilies), brachiopods, cephalopods and trilobites (ancient shrimp). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k40drb7qkssct85hmy1n2gqw))
- Amphibians became abundant in many parts of the world, and reptiles a hundred million years later. But there is no evidence of them in Ontario's geological record. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k40dx0vzxyt8sg7fpe8c215c))
- Perhaps 3 million years ago, [10](https://highparknature.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/TorontoGeology-2012Jan24_web.pdf/#page-7-9) water began to cut channels in the bedrock. The biggest ones created the axes of today's four lower Great Lakes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k40dz0vgzp1hqnmzv7zjhk79))
