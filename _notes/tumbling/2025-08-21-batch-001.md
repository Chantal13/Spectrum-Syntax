notes: "This is my first batch ever. I didn't know about filler media, so a few dalmatian jasper pieces cracked, and some pieces were still bumpier than I would have liked. I didn't know how smooth each rock should be, so I ended up moving some pieces along prematurely. Next time, I will separate the rocks that are ready to move on from those that aren't. They don't all need to stay in the tumbler together.

stages:
- stage: 1
  name: "Coarse Grind"
  start: "2025-07-13"
  end: "2025-08-23"
  grit: "60/90 SiC"
  amount_tbsp: 2
  barrel_fill_pct: "75%"
  water_level: "Just below top layer"
  media_used: "None"
  maintenance: "N/A"
  observations: "Ran twice (~5 days each). No filler media led to chips and cracks; should have removed smooth pieces after first run."
  decision:
    repeat: "no"
    why: "I wasn't sure how smooth the rocks needed to be before moving them along to the next stage."

- stage: 2
  name: "Medium Grind"
  grit: "120/220 SiC"
  amount_tbsp: 2
  barrel_fill_pct: "Use media ~30% of load"
  water_level: "Just below top layer"
  media_used: "None"
  maintenance: "Top-ups; noise/leaks; mid-week checks"
  observations: "Still learning what to look for; some stones probably needed another round, but everything moved forward."
