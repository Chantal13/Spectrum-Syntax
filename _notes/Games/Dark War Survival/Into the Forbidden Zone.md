**Into the Forbidden Zone** is Dark War Survival’s short, tower-defence-style side mode that unlocks as you progress through Adventure. You access it from your city (look for the small **ghost icon** above the Warehouse). Each stage asks you to protect your survivor by placing and upgrading defences while managing a simple economy; clears award a steady drip of **rubies**, **speedups**, and some resources, with payouts increasing at higher levels. 

In play, you build/upgrade turrets and basic income sources to survive waves; early levels are quick, later ones (e.g., the much-discussed level 28) spike in difficulty but pay more—players report rewards like ~200 rubies and ~90×1-minute speedups on that stage. It’s a reliable F2P routine: short sessions, meaningful premium-currency trickle, and no spending required—though it rewards careful placement and timely upgrades.

# Build & Upgrade Guide

## Core Strategy Flow

1. **Economy First** — Build [[coin generator|💰coin generators]] early; the more coins you produce, the faster you can upgrade.
2. **Upgrade the [[bed|🛏 bed]]** — Do this early to boost coin production.
3. **Defensive [[weapon|🔫 weapons]]** — Place **3 [[weapon|weapons]]** near the [[bed]] and upgrade them to **Level 4** quickly.
4. **Add a Fourth [[weapon]]** — Gives extra firepower when waves get harder.
5. **Upgrade [[weapon|Weapons]] Further** — Push main [[weapon|weapons]] to **Level 7** (or as high as you can).
6. **[[door|🚪 Door Upgrade Timing]]** — Only upgrade the [[door]] **when [[zombies]] are attacking it**, ideally from **Level 5 → Level 6**.

  [W4] [W1-Lv4] [W2-Lv4] [W3-Lv4]
                |
               [Door]  → Zombie Arrival
```


**Legend:**
- **[[bed]]**: Upgrade early to maximize coin gain.
- **Coin Gen**: Multiple units to strengthen your economy.
- **W1–W3**: First three [[weapon|weapons]]; get to Level 4 ASAP.
- **W4**: Backup [[weapon]] for extra coverage.
- **[[door|Door]]**: Upgrade reactively during attack.
