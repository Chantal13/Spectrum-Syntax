Zombies are the primary enemy in *[[Into the Forbidden Zone]]*.

---

## Function
- Moves toward your 🛏 [[bed]] or 🚪[[door]] with the goal of destroying them.
- Spawns in waves, increasing in strength as the game progresses.

---

## Importance
- Core threat — all building, upgrading, and timing revolve around stopping 🧟zombies.
- Higher-level zombies require stronger 🔫 weapons or timely 🚪[[door]] upgrades.

---

## Behavior
- Follows the shortest available path to your structures.
- Can be influenced by placement of defenses and walls to alter their route.
- Attacks the 🚪[[door]] first if present, otherwise targets the 🛏 [[bed]].

---

## Strategy
- Position 🔫 weapons to hit zombies for as long as possible before they reach your 🚪[[door]].
- Upgrade strategically to match the increasing 🧟 zombie HP in later waves.
- Delay contact with the 🚪[[door]] to avoid early damage.

---

## Tip
- Watch their movement patterns — pathing can sometimes be manipulated to buy more attack time.
