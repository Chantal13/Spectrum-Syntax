### (F2P-first, with optional small spends)

## Your goals (big picture)

- **Unlock systems fast** (Adventure → Radar/World Map → Events) so you can join rallies, gather, and snowball. Prioritise **Watchtower** (it gates hero level caps) and keep **troop camps + Research Lab** building or researching at all times.
    
- **Train nonstop.** Empty barracks = lost power. Use speedups during events or wars; otherwise keep queues full.
    

## Core army recipe

- **Troop mix.** Early on, run a **balanced front line + back line**: **Infantry (tanks) + Ranged DPS + Support**. A simple starting ratio like **3:2:1 (Infantry:Ranged:Support)** works until your heroes push you toward a specialty. Put Infantry up front; keep Ranged/Support in back.
    
- **Research > raw numbers.** Attack/HP/Defence research multiplies every unit you train. Keep troop tech rolling alongside building upgrades.
    
- **Formations.** Build at least one balanced “everyday” march, then a second for **PvP** (thicker front) and a third for **PvE** (more DPS/heal/CC). As you unlock more slots, specialise marches around your best hero auras/buffs.
    

## Heroes: where F2P power really comes from

- **Level cap and synergy.** Your **Watchtower** controls hero level caps—don’t let it bottleneck you. Match heroes to troop types and to each other’s passives/ultimates.
    
- **Spend shards wisely.** Use community tier lists to avoid trap investments, but don’t chase every banner.
    
- **Instructor/Training Centre.** Focus instructors on heroes you’ll keep long-term; you can reset trainees if plans change.
    

## Early- and mid-game priorities (F2P)

1. **Rush Adventure** to unlock the **Radar/World Map**, then run **Radar missions** regularly for mats, speedups, fragments, and rubies.
    
2. **Join an active alliance.** Rallies, help timers, and shared advice accelerate growth—and make shields/heals more affordable.
    
3. **Into the Forbidden Zone** (mini-game): quick stages, steady **ruby** trickle as you climb; higher levels = more rubies/speedups. Make it part of your routine.
    
4. **Resource use.** Don’t hoard so hard that buildings stall—use packs to keep **Watchtower, Radar, troop camps** moving. Save bigger bursts for point events once you’re competitive.
    

## PvE vs. PvP tweaks

- **PvE:** favour reliable DPS plus a healer/CC; keep infantry sufficient but not bloated.
    
- **PvP:** scout first; thicken the front line, bring anti-burst tools, and keep a **healing queue** ready so you bounce back after trades.
    

## Tiny spends that won’t wreck F2P integrity (optional)

- **VIP points / timed speedups:** Often decent value; skip generic resource packs you can farm.
    
- **Growth-type pass:** Consider mainly for **training speed**; treat as quality-of-life, not mandatory power.
    
- **Emergency shields/teleports:** Acceptable ruby sinks to protect troops during wars (cheaper than hospital time).
    

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Chasing every banner.** Pick a couple of proven heroes and build around them; meta churn and paywalls can drain rubies.
    
- **Idle barracks / capped hospitals.** Keep training; upgrade hospital capacity before big fights.
    
- **Ignoring clearable events.** Radar/mini-games and chapter/growth tasks are efficient drip feeds—don’t leave them unclaimed.
    

## TL;DR starter plan

**Build/research nonstop**, **train nonstop**, **Watchtower first**, **balanced army (Infantry/Ranged/Support)**, **join a strong alliance**, and **farm Radar + Forbidden Zone** for steady rubies/speedups. Add **VIP points** or a **growth pass** only if the perks match your goals; otherwise stay pure F2P and let events do the heavy lifting.
