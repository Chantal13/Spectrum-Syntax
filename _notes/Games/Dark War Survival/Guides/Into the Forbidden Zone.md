# Build & Upgrade Guide

## Core Strategy Flow

1. **Economy First** — Build [[coin generator|💰 coin generators]] early; the more coins you produce, the faster you can upgrade.
2. **Upgrade the [[bed|🛏 bed]]** — Do this early to boost coin production.
3. **Defensive [[weapon|🔫 weapons]]** — Place **3 [[weapon|weapons]]** near the [[bed]] and upgrade them to **Level 4** quickly.
4. **Add a Fourth [[weapon]]** — Gives extra firepower when waves get harder.
5. **Upgrade [[weapon|Weapons]] Further** — Push main [[weapon|weapons]] to **Level 7** (or as high as you can).
6. **[[door|🚪 Door Upgrade Timing]]** — Only upgrade the [[door]] **when [[zombie|zombies]] are attacking it**, ideally from **Level 5 → Level 6**.
