# ðŸ’° Coin Generator

In *Dark War Survival* ([[Into the Forbidden Zone]]), a **coin generator** is a structure that passively produces coins over time.

---

## Function
- **Primary Role**: Generates coins automatically, without player kills.
- **Currency Output**: Produces coins for building and upgrading [[weapon|weapons]], the [[bed]], and the [[door]].

---

## Importance
1. **Backbone of your economy** â€” More coins = faster upgrades.
2. **Early scaling** â€” Enables early [[weapon]] and [[bed]] upgrades.
3. **Reduces downtime** â€” Keeps coins flowing even between waves.

---

## Placement
- Flank the [[bed]] on one or two sides for compact defense.
- Group them for easier protection.

---

## Build Timing
1. **Start of the game** â€” Place 1â€“2 generators immediately.
2. **Before heavy upgrades** â€” Upgrade [[bed]] and add more generators early.
3. **Mid-run** â€” Add more if you have downtime and safe space.

---

## Recommended Count
- **Early Game**: 2â€“3
- **Mid Game**: 4â€“6
- **Late Game**: Add if safe, but prioritize [[weapon|weapons]]/[[door]].

---

## Upgrade Priority
1. Upgrade **[[bed]] first**, then generators.
2. Early level increases pay off over time.
3. Late game â€” spend on defenses instead of maxing generator levels.
