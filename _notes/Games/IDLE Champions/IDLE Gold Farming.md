## ‚ùì Why Do We Need to Farm Gold?

Gold farming matters for **progression at all stages** of [[IDLE Champions]]:

1. **Adding/Leveling Champions** ‚Äì Gold lets you build stronger formations.
    
2. **Earning Favor** ‚Äì Gold converts into Favor at the end of a run. Favor is spent on **Blessings**, boosting future runs.
    
3. **Difficulty Ratings** ‚Äì Favor influences adventure difficulty. _Note: ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù does not always mean ‚Äúyou can clear it.‚Äù_
    
4. **Click Damage Boosts** ‚Äì Early-game runs are faster if you level click damage. _(Rule: keep click level ‚â• current area number)._
    
5. **Legendary Upgrades** ‚Äì Favor thresholds must be met to upgrade Legendary effects in the **Trials of Mt. Tiamat**.

## ‚è≥ When Should We Farm Gold?

Farming gold isn‚Äôt for every run. The key is knowing **when**:

1. **Starting a New Campaign**
    
    - First run = push as far as possible for Favor.
        
    - Only repeat deep Favor runs if the next adventure is not ‚ÄúGreen/Easy.‚Äù
        
2. **Events**
    
    - Events start at zero Favor.
        
    - Favor determines progress in Tiers 1 & 2.
        
    - Converts into permanent campaign Favor at **+10% per e01 Favor**.
        
3. **Time Gates**
    
    - Start at zero Favor.
        
    - Use initial adventures to farm Favor before attempting Variants.
        
    - Favor converts into campaign Favor after closing.
        
4. **Trials of Mount Tiamat**
    
    - Start at zero Favor.
        
    - Multiple runs on Day 1 can maximize contributions.
        
5. **Buying All Blessings**
    
    - Easy campaigns: done passively.
        
    - Harder campaigns: deep pushes required.
        
6. **Forge Runs**
    
    - Required for upgrading Legendary Effects.

## üåä What Is a Deep Favor Run?

- A **Deep Favor run** = pushing as far as possible for maximum gold scaling.
    
- Deep runs give you the chance to:
    
    - Earn much higher Favor.
        
    - Experiment with formations.
        
    - Use **Gold Find Champions** for optimized farming.

- **Old-school gold farm** method.
    
- Build **two formations**:
    
    1. High BUD formation with tanks holding ~100 enemies.
        
    2. Gold Find formation centered on **Makos** (_Dark Luck specialization_).
        
- Fire Makos‚Äô Ultimate into the stack for massive gold.
    
- Works best with Evil/Warlock synergies + Sgt. Knox buffs.
    
- Limited by RNG & setup time.

- Build **two formations**:
    
    1. Deep-push formation.
        
    2. Gold Find formation with **Azaka** (_Resist the Curse_ specialization).
        
- Azaka‚Äôs Ultimate makes enemies drop gold ‚Äúas if killed‚Äù without dying.
    
- Setup involves:
    
    - Isolating a **single enemy** (boss or minion).
        
    - Farming it repeatedly with Azaka‚Äôs tigers.

- Requires **two formations**:
    
    1. Pushing formation (sets highest BUD).
        
    2. Gold Find formation (highest % at top-left of UI).
        
- Use **Fire Breath potion + Familiars** to kill instantly.
    
- Swap formations to collect massive gold.
    
- Fast, flexible, works at all stages.
    
- Many players now use this exclusively.

## üß≠ Which Method Should You Use?

- **Makos Bombing** ‚Äì Niche, requires setup, not efficient today.
    
- **Azaka Farming** ‚Äì High effort, still useful for very high Favor goals.
    
- **Dirrty/BUD Farming** ‚Äì Best for **most players**, from early to late game.
