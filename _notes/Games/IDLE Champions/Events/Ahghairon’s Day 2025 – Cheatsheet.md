## 💡 Key Tips

- Tokens: ~72,500 total (1 every ~25s, passive).
    
- Don’t “Complete” early—farm **Favor** first.
    
- Avoid sitting at walls—run **Free Plays** for max efficiency.
    
- **New players:** Wait until Variants show _Easy_ before trying.
    
- Favor converts into campaign favor (up to 130%).

## ⭐ Recommendations

- **New players:** Prioritize **Ellywick, Shandie, Lae’zel** (speed & gem farming).
    
- **Experienced players:** Chase Epics for frequently used champs (Ellywick’s Epic Deck of Many Things is strong).
