# Conglomerate vs Breccia

| Feature                        | Conglomerate                                                                  | Breccia                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rock Type**                  | Sedimentary                                                                   | Sedimentary (sometimes volcanic)                                                       |
| **Clast Shape**                | Rounded pebbles & cobbles                                                     | Angular, jagged fragments                                                              |
| **Clast Size**                 | > 2 mm (pebbles, cobbles, boulders)                                           | > 2 mm (same size range as conglomerate)                                               |
| **Cement**                     | Sand, silt, silica, or calcite                                                | Clay, calcite, silica, or volcanic ash                                                 |
| **Appearance**                 | Looks like a “stone fruitcake” or puddingstone                                | Looks like a “jigsaw puzzle” of broken rock                                            |
| **Formation**                  | Fragments transported by water (river/shoreline) and rounded before cementing | Fragments broken in place by faulting, landslides, or eruptions, then quickly cemented |
| **Durability**                 | Usually well-cemented, but varies                                             | Varies widely; some crumble if cement is soft                                          |
| **Tumbling**                   | Polishes into colourful speckled stones (good with [[jasper]] or [[quartz]] clasts)   | Can polish well if silica-cemented, but often uneven due to mixed hardness             |
| **Where Found (Lake Ontario)** | Glacial gravels, pebble beaches, puddingstone erratics                        | Less common; occasional erratics in mixed gravels                                      |
