Epidote is a green **silicate mineral** that often forms during metamorphism when other minerals are altered by heat, pressure, and hydrothermal fluids. It is best known for giving **[[unakite]]** its striking green color (alongside pink [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]]).  

While epidote rarely appears as large standalone crystals along Lake Ontario’s beaches, it is an important mineral to recognize because of its role in [[unakite]] and some metamorphic rocks.

## Appearance & Identification
- **Color:** Pistachio-green to dark green  
- **Luster:** Vitreous (glassy)  
- **Transparency:** Transparent to translucent  
- **Crystal Habit:** Prismatic or granular, but often massive  
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7  
- **Cleavage:** One good cleavage plane  

> [!tip] Field ID  
> Epidote is usually seen as green patches or grains in **[[unakite]] pebbles**. Look for the pink + green mottled pattern.

## [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] Qualities
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7 (similar to [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]])  
- **Polishing Notes:**  
  - Epidote alone is not often tumbled, but in [[unakite]] it polishes well.  
  - Produces a smooth, satin-like finish with rich green tones.  
- **Lapidary Use:** Sometimes cut into cabochons or beads, often as part of [[unakite]].  

> [!warning] Pure epidote can be brittle and may fracture in a tumbler. Works best when polished as part of [[unakite]].

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** Forms during metamorphism of [[feldspar]]-rich rocks (like [[granite]]).  
- **Transport:** Epidote-rich rocks (like [[unakite]] and [[gneiss]]) were carried south from the Canadian Shield by glaciers.  
- **Where to Find:**  
  - Primarily in **[[unakite]] pebbles** on GTA & Durham beaches (Scarborough, Rouge River, Lynde Shores, Darlington).  
  - Rarely as standalone mineral fragments.
