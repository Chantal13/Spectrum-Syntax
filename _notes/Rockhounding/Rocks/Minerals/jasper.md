Jasper is an opaque chalcedony ([[quartz|quartz]]) coloured by mineral impurities, usually iron oxides. It often originates in silica-rich [[sedimentary]] deposits, though glacial action has moved it widely.  

**Appearance & Identification:**  
- Opaque, solid colors  
- Reds, browns, yellows, greens  
- Patterns: speckled, striped, or brecciated  
- Lacks translucency (distinguishes it from [[agate]])  

> [!tip] Tumbling Qualities  
> - Hardness: [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6.5–7  
> - Produces a glossy, smooth polish  
> - Colors deepen after [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]]  

**Rock Category:** **[[Sedimentary]]**, though considered part of the [[quartz]] family.
