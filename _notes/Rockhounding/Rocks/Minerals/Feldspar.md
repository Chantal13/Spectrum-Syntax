## Overview
Feldspar is a group of **rock-forming minerals** that make up more than half of the Earth’s crust. They are the primary components of many [[igneous]], [[metamorphic]], and [[sedimentary]] rocks, and serve as the “framework” minerals that bind rocks together.  

On the north shores of Lake Ontario, feldspar is most often found as part of **[[granite]], [[gneiss]], and [[unakite]] pebbles** brought south from the Canadian Shield by glaciers. While rarely collected as a standalone mineral in beach gravels, it’s an essential part of many [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]]-quality rocks.

## Appearance & Identification
- **Color:** White, pink, grey, green, or occasionally blue  
- **Luster:** Glassy to pearly  
- **Transparency:** Usually opaque, sometimes translucent on thin edges  
- **Cleavage:** Distinct flat surfaces where crystals break cleanly (2 directions at right angles)  
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6  
- **Common Varieties:**  
  - **Orthoclase:** Pink feldspar common in granites  
  - **Plagioclase:** White to grey feldspar with striations (fine parallel lines)  
  - **Microcline:** Green variety, sometimes striking  

> [!tip] Field ID  
> Feldspar often appears as the pink, white, or green mineral in **[[granite]]** or **[[gneiss]]**. Look for its flat cleavage planes and pearly luster.

## Tumbling Qualities
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6 (softer than [[quartz]])  
- **Polishing Notes:**  
  - Polishes less brilliantly than [[quartz]], but can still develop a smooth satin shine.  
  - Works well when tumbled in combination rocks ([[granite]], [[unakite]]).  
  - Green feldspar in [[unakite]] looks striking after polishing.  
- **Lapidary Use:** Sometimes cut into cabochons, decorative stones, or used in ceramics and glass.  

> [!warning] Pure feldspar is softer than [[quartz]] — don’t tumble it with harder stones like [[agate]] or [[jasper]], or it may undercut.

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** Feldspar crystallizes in [[igneous|igneous rocks]] like [[granite]], then is reworked into metamorphic rocks like [[gneiss]] and [[unakite]].  
- **Transport:** Glaciers carried feldspar-bearing rocks from the Canadian Shield to Southern Ontario.  
- **Where to Find:**  
  - **[[Granite]] pebbles** (pink feldspar visible) on Toronto and Durham beaches  
  - **[[Unakite]] pebbles** (pink feldspar + green epidote + [[quartz]])  
  - **[[Gneiss]]** with alternating feldspar and [[quartz]] bands

## Rock Family
Feldspar is a **mineral group**, not a rock. It is most closely tied to:  
- **Igneous Rocks** → [[Granite]], basalt (plagioclase feldspar)  
- **Metamorphic Rocks** → [[Gneiss]], schist, [[unakite]]  
- **Sedimentary Rocks** → Sandstone often contains feldspar grains

## Related Stones
- **[[Granite]]** → Made of [[quartz]], feldspar, and mica  
- **[[Unakite]]** → Pink feldspar, green epidote, and [[quartz]]  
- **[[Gneiss]]** → Banded rock often alternating feldspar and [[quartz]]  
- **[[Quartz]]** → Often found alongside feldspar in many rocks
