**Appearance & Identification:**  
- Milky quartz: opaque white  
- Smoky quartz: translucent grey-brown  
- Chalcedony: waxy and semi-translucent  
- Hardness test: scratches glass  

> [!tip] Tumbling Qualities  
> - Hardness: Mohs 7  
> - Very durable  
> - Polishes to a reflective, glass-like finish  

**Rock Category:** Present in **all three rock types**.

> [!info] Fun fact:  
> Quartz appears in **all three rock families** — [[Igneous]], [[Sedimentary]], and [[Metamorphic]] — which is why it’s so common.
