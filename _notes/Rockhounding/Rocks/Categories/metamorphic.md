# Metamorphic Rocks

**Definition:**  
Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are transformed by heat, pressure, or chemical processes without melting.

**Types:**  
- **Foliated:** Layered or banded (e.g., schist, [[Gneiss]]).  
- **Non-foliated:** Uniform texture (e.g., marble, quartzite).  

**Common Features:**  
- May have shiny or banded surfaces  
- Can contain mineral crystals (garnet, kyanite, etc.)  
- More resistant to erosion  

**Connection to Rockhounding:**  
- [[Unakite]] is a metamorphic granite altered by hydrothermal fluids.  
- Garnet-bearing [[Gneiss]] is also found in Lake Ontario pebbles.  

> [!tip] Metamorphic rocks are among the best candidates for tumbling due to their durability and striking colors.  

> [!tip] Example connection:  
> **[[Unakite]]** and garnet-bearing [[Gneiss]] are common metamorphic stones found on Lake Ontario’s shores.
