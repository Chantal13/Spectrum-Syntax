Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are transformed by heat, pressure, or chemical processes without melting.

**Types:**  
- **Foliated:** Layered or banded (e.g., schist, [[Gneiss]]).  
- **Non-foliated:** Uniform texture (e.g., marble, quartzite).  

**Common Features:**  
- May have shiny or banded surfaces  
- Can contain mineral crystals ([[garnet]], kyanite, etc.)  
- More resistant to erosion  

**Connection to [[Rockhounding]]:**  
- [[Unakite]] is a metamorphic [[granite]] altered by hydrothermal fluids.  
- [[Garnet]]-bearing [[Gneiss]] is also found in Lake Ontario pebbles.  

Metamorphic rocks are among the best candidates for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]] due to their durability and striking colours.  


> **[[Unakite]]** and [[garnet]]-bearing [[gneiss]] are common metamorphic stones found on Lake Ontarioâ€™s shores.
