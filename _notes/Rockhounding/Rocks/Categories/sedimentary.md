# Sedimentary Rocks

**Definition:**  
Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation and compaction of sediments such as sand, clay, or organic material.

**Types:**  
- **Clastic:** Made of weathered fragments (e.g., sandstone, shale).  
- **Chemical:** From mineral precipitation (e.g., limestone, dolostone).  
- **Organic:** From plant/animal remains (e.g., coal).  

**Common Features:**  
- Often layered or banded  
- May contain fossils  
- Softer than [[Igneous]]/[[Metamorphic]] rocks  

**Connection to Rockhounding:**  
- [[Jasper]] is a silica-rich sedimentary form of [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]].  
- Limestone and shale also occur along Lake Ontario but are too soft for tumbling.  

> [!warning] Soft sedimentary rocks like shale and limestone will not polish well in a tumbler. Stick to harder varieties like [[Jasper]].
