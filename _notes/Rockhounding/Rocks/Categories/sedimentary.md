# Sedimentary Rocks

**Definition:**  
Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation and compaction of sediments such as sand, clay, or organic material.

**Types:**  
- **Clastic:** Made of weathered fragments (e.g., sandstone, shale).  
- **Chemical:** From mineral precipitation (e.g., limestone, dolostone).  
- **Organic:** From plant/animal remains (e.g., coal).  

**Common Features:**  
- Often layered or banded  
- May contain fossils  
- Softer than [[igneous]]/[[metamorphic]] rocks  


>  Soft sedimentary rocks like shale and limestone will not polish well in a tumbler. Stick to harder varieties like [[Jasper]].
