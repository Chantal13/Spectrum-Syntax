# Igneous Rocks

**Definition:**  
Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. They are the “fire-born” rocks of Earth’s crust.

**Types:**  
- **Intrusive (plutonic):** Cooled slowly underground. Coarse-grained (e.g., granite, gabbro).  
- **Extrusive (volcanic):** Cooled quickly on the surface. Fine-grained (e.g., basalt, pumice, obsidian).  

**Common Features:**  
- Often hard and dense  
- May contain visible crystals (granite) or glassy textures (obsidian)  

**Connection to Rockhounding:**  
- [[Agate|Agates]] often form inside cavities (vesicles) of volcanic rocks.  
- Granite erratics transported by glaciers can be found along Lake Ontario.  

> [!note] Examples along Lake Ontario include [[Agate|agates]] in glacial gravels and granite pebbles.  

> [!tip] Example connection:  
> Many **[[Agate|agates]]** found along Lake Ontario originated in igneous rocks before glaciers carried them south.
