Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. They are the “fire-born” rocks of Earth’s crust.

**Types:**  
- **Intrusive (plutonic):** Cooled slowly underground. Coarse-grained (e.g., [[granite]], gabbro).  
- **Extrusive (volcanic):** Cooled quickly on the surface. Fine-grained (e.g., basalt, pumice, [[obsidian]]).  

**Common Features:**  
- Often hard and dense  
- May contain visible crystals ([[granite]]) or glassy textures ([[obsidian]])  

**Connection to [[rockhounding]]:**  
- [[agate|Agates]] often form inside cavities (vesicles) of volcanic rocks.  
- [[granite]] erratics transported by glaciers can be found along Lake Ontario.  


> Many **[[agate|agates]]** found along Lake Ontario originated in igneous rocks before glaciers carried them south.
