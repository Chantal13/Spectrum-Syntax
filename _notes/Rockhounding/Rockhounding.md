Rockhounding is the hobby of searching for, identifying, and collecting rocks, minerals, and the occasional fossil. It blends time outdoors with hands-on learning about geology—how rocks form, where minerals occur, and what clues in the landscape point to good finds. Responsible rockhounding also means knowing the rules (land access and permits), practising safe fieldwork, and respecting the environment and cultural sites.

Most of what I share here will focus on rockhounding in Ontario, Canada—think shorelines, glacial deposits, and the Canadian Shield. However, the techniques, tools, safety tips, identification guides, and lapidary basics apply almost anywhere. Whether you’re combing a Great Lakes beach or exploring a creek bed across the world, you’ll be able to use these methods to plan trips, recognise common specimens, and build an ethical, well-documented collection.
