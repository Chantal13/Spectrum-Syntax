The shores of Lake Ontario, shaped by glaciers and erosion, offer a treasure trove of collectible stones. From colourful [[jasper]] to translucent [[agate|agates]], many of these beach-worn pebbles are perfect candidates for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]] and polishing. This guide highlights what to look for, where to go, and how to get started.

## 🪨 Rock Categories in Context

- **[[Igneous]] Rocks** → Formed from cooled magma/lava. 
	- Example: Basalt, [[granite]]. 
	- Connection: [[agate|Agate]].  
- **[[Sedimentary]] Rocks** → Formed from compressed sediments. 
	- Example: Limestone, sandstone. 
	- Connection: [[jasper|Jasper]].  
- **[[Metamorphic]] Rocks** → Formed by heat and pressure. 
	- Example: [[Gneiss]], schist. 
	- Connection: [[Unakite]].

## 🌊 Why These Rocks Wash Up

1. **Glaciers** carried and deposited erratics from the north.  
2. **Rivers** transport stones from inland.  
3. **Wave action** smooths and rounds pebbles.  
4. **Cliff erosion** (e.g., Scarborough Bluffs) adds new material.

## 🪨 Tips for Collecting

- **Timing matters:** After storms or high winds, waves churn up fresh material.
    
- **Search zones:** Look at pebble lines along the water’s edge, especially near **creek mouths**.
    
- **Do the wet test:** Dip stones in water—colors and banding pop when wet.
    
- **Respect nature:** Follow conservation rules, and don’t collect from protected areas.

## 🔍 Tips for Identifying Stones

- **[[agate|Agates]]:** Look for translucency and banding (hold to light).
    
- **[[Jasper]]:** Opaque, solid colors—reds and greens are most common.
    
- **[[quartz|Quartz]]:** Glassy appearance, hardness test scratches glass.
    
- **[[Unakite]]:** Green-pink mottling ([[feldspar]] + [[epidote]]).
    
- **[[conglomerate|Conglomerates]]:** Pebbles cemented together, often with [[Jasper]] chunks.

> **Tip:** Bring a small **field guide** or use an app like _Rock Identifier_ for on-the-spot help.

## 🎒 Recommended Rockhounding Equipment

- **Rock hammer & chisel** (for creek beds or breaking larger stones).
    
- **Geologist’s hand lens** (10× magnification for spotting details).
    
- **Small backpack or bucket** for carrying finds.
    
- **Sturdy gloves** and **safety glasses** for handling sharp rocks.
    
- **Mesh bag** for rinsing pebbles in the lake.
    
- **Field notebook / phone camera** to document locations.

## ⚙️ Tips for Rock Tumbling|Tumbling Lake Ontario Stones

1. **Sort by hardness** – Tumble [[quartz]], [[jasper]], and [[agate]] together ([[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6.5–7). Softer rocks will grind away too quickly.
    
2. **Start small** – Many Lake Ontario stones are already rounded; use shorter coarse grind cycles.
    
3. **Stage by grit** – Standard 4-step process: coarse (60–90 grit), medium (120–220), fine (500), polish (cerium oxide or tin oxide).
    
4. **Fill your barrel** – Use ceramic filler or smaller pebbles to cushion larger stones.
    
5. **Patience pays** – [[agate|Agates]] and [[jasper]] may take longer in coarse grind but reward with brilliant polish.
    
6. **Check progress often** – Some glacial stones contain fractures; remove weak pieces early.
