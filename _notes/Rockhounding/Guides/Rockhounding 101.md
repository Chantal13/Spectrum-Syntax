# [[Rockhounding]] & [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] along Lake Ontario‚Äôs Greater Toronto Shoreline

The shores of Lake Ontario, shaped by glaciers and erosion, offer a treasure trove of collectible stones. From colourful [[Jasper]] to translucent [[agate|agates]], many of these beach-worn pebbles are perfect candidates for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]] and polishing. This guide highlights what to look for, where to go, and how to get started.

## ü™® Rock Categories in Context

- **[[Igneous]] Rocks** ‚Üí Formed from cooled magma/lava. Example: basalt, [[granite]]. Connection: [[agate|Agates]].  
- **[[Sedimentary]] Rocks** ‚Üí Formed from compressed sediments. Example: limestone, sandstone. Connection: [[Jasper]].  
- **[[Metamorphic]] Rocks** ‚Üí Formed by heat and pressure. Example: [[Gneiss]], schist. Connection: [[Unakite]].  

---
## üåä Why These Rocks Wash Up

1. **Glaciers** carried and deposited erratics from the north.  
2. **Rivers** transport stones from inland.  
3. **Wave action** smooths and rounds pebbles.  
4. **Cliff erosion** (e.g., Scarborough Bluffs) adds new material.

## üß≠ Recommended Locations in GTA & Durham

> [!tip] **Best Overall ‚Äì Scarborough Bluffs / Bluffer‚Äôs Park (Toronto)**  
> Erosion supplies fresh sandstone, shale, and occasional [[agate]] or [[Jasper]] pebbles. Great mix of [[Sedimentary]] and glacial erratics.  

> [!tip] **Tommy Thompson Park & Cherry Beach (Toronto)**  
> Pebble-rich shoreline, diverse [[Metamorphic]] and [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]] finds.  

> [!tip] **Ashbridge‚Äôs Bay & The Beaches (Toronto)**  
> Smooth, rounded glacial pebbles ‚Äî good for [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]] and [[Jasper]].  

> [!tip] **Rouge River & Don Valley Outflows (Toronto)**  
> Streams deliver a constant supply of mixed glacial rocks.  

> [!tip] **Lynde Shores Conservation Area (Whitby)**  
> Gravel barrier beach ‚Äî excellent for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]]-size stones.  

> [!tip] **Darlington Provincial Park (Bowmanville)**  
> Glacial moraine shoreline ‚Äî [[Unakite]], [[Jasper]], and [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]] show up here.  

> [!tip] **Pickering Beach / Paradise Beach & Carruthers Creek Mouth (Ajax)**  
> Sandy-pebble beaches ‚Äî small [[agate|agates]] and [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]] often appear after storms.

## ü™® Tips for Collecting

- **Timing matters:** After storms or high winds, waves churn up fresh material.
    
- **Search zones:** Look at pebble lines along the water‚Äôs edge, especially near **creek mouths**.
    
- **Do the wet test:** Dip stones in water‚Äîcolors and banding pop when wet.
    
- **Respect nature:** Follow conservation rules, and don‚Äôt collect from protected areas.

## üîç Tips for Identifying Stones

- **[[agate|Agates]]:** Look for translucency and banding (hold to light).
    
- **[[Jasper]]:** Opaque, solid colors‚Äîreds and greens are most common.
    
- **[[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]]:** Glassy appearance, hardness test scratches glass.
    
- **[[Unakite]]:** Green-pink mottling ([[feldspar]] + [[epidote]]).
    
- **Conglomerates:** Pebbles cemented together, often with [[Jasper]] chunks.

Bring a small **field guide** or use an app like _Rock Identifier_ for on-the-spot help.

## üéí Recommended [[Rockhounding]] Equipment

- **Rock hammer & chisel** (for creek beds or breaking larger stones).
    
- **Geologist‚Äôs hand lens** (10√ó magnification for spotting details).
    
- **Small backpack or bucket** for carrying finds.
    
- **Sturdy gloves** and **safety glasses** for handling sharp rocks.
    
- **Mesh bag** for rinsing pebbles in the lake.
    
- **Field notebook / phone camera** to document locations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips for [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] Lake Ontario Stones

1. **Sort by hardness** ‚Äì Tumble [[Notes/Rockhounding/Rocks/Minerals/Quartz|Quartz]], [[Jasper]], and [[agate]] together ([[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6.5‚Äì7). Softer rocks will grind away too quickly.
    
2. **Start small** ‚Äì Many Lake Ontario stones are already rounded; use shorter coarse grind cycles.
    
3. **Stage by grit** ‚Äì Standard 4-step process: coarse (60‚Äì90 grit), medium (120‚Äì220), fine (500), polish (cerium oxide or tin oxide).
    
4. **Fill your barrel** ‚Äì Use ceramic filler or smaller pebbles to cushion larger stones.
    
5. **Patience pays** ‚Äì [[agate|Agates]] and [[Jasper]] may take longer in coarse grind but reward with brilliant polish.
    
6. **Check progress often** ‚Äì Some glacial stones contain fractures; remove weak pieces early.
