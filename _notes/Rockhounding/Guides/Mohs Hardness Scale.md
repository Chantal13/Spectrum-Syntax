# Lake Ontario Rocks

The **Mohs Hardness Scale** ranks minerals from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest).  
This chart shows the common tumbling stones found along the north shores of Lake Ontario.

---

## Hardness 3 – 4 (Soft Stones)
- **Marble** → Mohs ~3 (calcite-based, scratches easily)  
- **Sandstone** → Mohs 3–4 (varies with quartz content; softer types crumble in tumbling)  

> [!warning] These stones are soft and not ideal for tumbling with harder materials. Tumble separately and handle gently.

---

## Hardness 5 – 6 (Medium Hard Stones)
- **Feldspar** → Mohs 6 (pink, white, or green crystals in granite, unakite, gneiss)  
- **Epidote** → Mohs 6–7 (green mineral, takes a satin polish)  
- **Unakite** → Mohs 6 (composite rock of feldspar, epidote, quartz – hardness varies)  
- **Conglomerate** → Mohs 5–6 (depends on cement and pebbles inside)  
- **Breccia** → Mohs 5–6 (similar to conglomerate but with angular fragments)  
- **Granite** → Mohs 6–7 (mix of feldspar and quartz, usually solid enough for tumbling)  
- **Gneiss** → Mohs 6–7 (metamorphic, alternating feldspar and quartz bands)  

> [!tip] Medium hardness stones can be tumbled together. Expect mixed results with polish — feldspar surfaces may look satin while quartz shines.

## Hardness 6.5 – 7 (Hard Stones – Excellent for Tumbling)
- **Quartz** → Mohs 7 (clear, white, smoky varieties common)  
- **Agate** → Mohs 7 (banded microcrystalline quartz, polishes to a glass-like shine)  
- **Jasper** → Mohs 6.5–7 (opaque quartz, excellent for tumbling)  
- **Chert / Flint** → Mohs 7 (cryptocrystalline quartz, tough and glossy when polished)  
- **Petrified Wood** → Mohs 6.5–7 (silica replacement, takes a strong polish)  
- **Basalt** → Mohs 6 (fine-grained volcanic rock, often smooth but not shiny)  

> [!tip] These are the **favourite stones for tumbling**. They hold up well, take a bright polish, and are the most durable in a tumbler.

## Notes
- Hardness is approximate — many of these rocks are composites of several minerals.  
- For best results, **tumble rocks of similar hardness together**. Mixing soft and hard stones will damage the softer ones.  
- Quartz-rich stones (agate, jasper, chert) are the best tumbling candidates in this region.
