The Mohs hardness scale ranks minerals by their resistance to scratching, from **1 (talc)** to **10 (diamond)**. It’s an **ordinal**, **non-linear** field test: if mineral A scratches mineral B, then A is harder. You identify an unknown by trying to scratch it with reference minerals (or everyday items with known hardness) and narrowing the range. Because the steps aren’t equal—diamond is far harder than corundum even though they’re only one step apart—the scale is best for quick comparisons, not precise engineering values. Hardness also differs from **toughness** (resistance to breaking) and **cleavage** (how a mineral splits), so a hard mineral can still chip or shatter.

## Hardness 3 – 4 (Soft Stones)
- **Marble** → Mohs ~3 (calcite-based, scratches easily)  
- **Sandstone** → Mohs 3–4 (varies with [[quartz]] content; softer types crumble in [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]])  

> [!warning] These stones are soft and not ideal for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]] with harder materials. Tumble separately and handle gently.

## Hardness 5 – 6 (Medium Hard Stones)
- **Feldspar** → Mohs 6 (pink, white, or green crystals in [[granite]], [[unakite]], [[gneiss]])  
- **Epidote** → Mohs 6–7 (green mineral, takes a satin polish)  
- **[[unakite]]** → Mohs 6 (composite rock of [[feldspar]], epidote, [[quartz]] – hardness varies)  
- **Conglomerate** → Mohs 5–6 (depends on cement and pebbles inside)  
- **[[breccia]]** → Mohs 5–6 (similar to conglomerate but with angular fragments)  
- **[[granite]]** → Mohs 6–7 (mix of [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]], usually solid enough for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]])  
- **[[gneiss]]** → Mohs 6–7 (metamorphic, alternating [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]] bands)  

> [!tip] Medium hardness stones can be tumbled together. Expect mixed results with polish — [[feldspar]] surfaces may look satin while [[quartz]] shines.

## Hardness 6.5 – 7 (Hard Stones – Excellent for [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]])
- **[[quartz]]** → Mohs 7 (clear, white, smoky varieties common)  
- **[[agate]]** → Mohs 7 (banded microcrystalline [[quartz]], polishes to a glass-like shine)  
- **[[jasper]]** → Mohs 6.5–7 (opaque [[quartz]], excellent for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]])  
- **Chert / Flint** → Mohs 7 (cryptocrystalline [[quartz]], tough and glossy when polished)  
- **Petrified Wood** → Mohs 6.5–7 (silica replacement, takes a strong polish)  
- **Basalt** → Mohs 6 (fine-grained volcanic rock, often smooth but not shiny)  

> [!tip] These are the **favourite stones for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]]**. They hold up well, take a bright polish, and are the most durable in a tumbler.

| **6.5–7** | [[jasper]], Petrified Wood |
| **7** | [[quartz]], [[agate]], Chert/Flint |

## Notes
- Hardness is approximate — many of these rocks are composites of several minerals.  
- For best results, **tumble rocks of similar hardness together**. Mixing soft and hard stones will damage the softer ones.  
- [[quartz]]-rich stones ([[agate]], [[jasper]], chert) are the best [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]] candidates in this region.
