> **Material mix:**  
> **Target finish:** (matte | satin | high-gloss)  
> **Notes:**  

## Equipment Used
- Tumbler:: Nat Geo Professional (2-lb rubber barrel)
- Barrel(s):: 1 × 2 lb
- RPM / speed setting:: (1/2/3)
- Timer setting:: (hrs/days; up to 12 days)
- Media on hand:: (ceramic smalls recommended)
- Grits/polishes on hand:: (SiC 60/90, SiC 120/220, SiC/AO 500, AO polish)

## Rock Inventory (Rough)
| ID | Origin (where/when) | Identification | Mohs | Size (mm) | Starting Weight (g) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| R-01 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| R-02 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Total starting weight (g)::**  
**Fragility risks (pits, cracks, soft inclusions)::**

> [!tip] Load & Fill
> Target **2/3–3/4 full**. Stage 1: mostly rocks. Stages 2–4: add **20–35% smalls/media** to cushion & carry grit.

## Stage 1 — Coarse Grind
**Grit:** 60/90 SiC  
**Start:** {{date}} **End:**  \_ \_ \_  **Duration (days)::**  
- Barrel fill %::  
- Water level:: (just below top layer / measured mL)  
- Media used:: (Y/N; type/size)  
- **Grit amount (Tbsp)::** 2  *(rule: ~2 Tbsp per lb rock; if ~1 lb of rocks, use ~2 Tbsp)*  
- Maintenance:: (burped? top-ups? leaks?)  
- Observations:: (chipping, froth, noise, smell)

**Decision:** Repeat Stage 1? (Y/N) — Why::

---

## Stage 2 — Medium Grind
**Grit:** 120/220 SiC  
**Start:**  **End:**  **Duration (days)::**  
- Barrel fill %:: (use media ~30% of load)  
- Water level::  
- Media used::  
- **Grit amount (Tbsp)::** 2  
- Maintenance::  
- Observations::  

---

## Stage 3 — Pre-Polish
**Grit:** 500 (SiC or AO)  
**Start:**  **End:**  **Duration (days)::**  
- Barrel fill %::  
- Water level::  
- Media used::  
- **Grit amount (Tbsp)::** 2  
- Observations:: (scratches gone? even surface?)

---

## Stage 4 — Polish
**Polish:** Aluminum Oxide (e.g., TXP)  
**Start:**  **End:**  **Duration (days)::**  
- Barrel fill %::  
- Water level::  
- Media used:: (dedicated polish-only media recommended)  
- **Polish amount (Tbsp)::** 2  
- Observations:: (shine level, haze, orange peel)

---

## Optional Finishing
**Burnish:** Soap/Borax, ~30–120 min (≈1 tsp per lb of load).  
**GemFoam run (optional):** follow kit directions; note duration & effect.  
Result notes::

## Cleaning & Cross-Contamination Checklist
- [ ] Rinse rocks thoroughly between stages (don’t let slurry dry on).  
- [ ] Scrub rocks & barrel (seams, crevices, lid).  
- [ ] Use **stage-dedicated media** for polish or clean it meticulously.  
- [ ] **Do not** pour slurry down drains; collect & dispose responsibly.  
- [ ] Inspect for pits/cracks before advancing.
