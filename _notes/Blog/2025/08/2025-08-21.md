# Baby's First Rock Tumbling Batch  

I decided to try rock tumbling after stumbling across some National Geographic kits online. As a kid, I was always drawn to rocks and shells — especially ones I could crack open in search of fossils — but I never really thought about collecting stones to polish. Seeing those kits reminded me how much I enjoy science and nature, and the idea of taking something billions of years old and giving it new life by polishing it felt fascinating.

My goal with tumbling is to learn more about rockhounding and identifying rocks and minerals. I want to understand the process well enough to get the best results I can. And once I find some pieces I really love, I’d like to turn them into jewellery for myself, friends, and family.

For equipment, I used the [National Geographic Professional Rock Tumbler](https://www.amazon.ca/NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-Professional-Rock-Tumbler/dp/B086Z83SV5/ref=sr17). It came with a four-stage grit kit and some starter stones. I didn’t use any filler media, which turned out to be a mistake — a few of the Dalmatian [[Jasper]] pieces cracked into tiny fragments because the barrel wasn’t full enough.

## Before Tumbling

The starter stones that came with the kit — a mix of [[quartz]], [[jasper]], and others. I have no idea what I am doing or looking at yet.

## After Coarse Stage

The coarse stage ran twice, about five days each time. Looking back, I should have removed the smoother rocks after the first round instead of tumbling everything again.

After two rounds of coarse grit — some rocks smoothed out nicely, while others chipped or cracked.

## After Medium & Fine Stages

By the medium stage, I still wasn’t sure what I should be looking for in terms of surface quality. Some stones probably could have used another run here, but I moved everything forward together.

The fine stage felt similar. Again, I didn’t really know what to expect, so some rocks advanced before they were truly ready.

## After Polish

For polishing, I used the kit’s stage 4 polish and finished with a short soap cycle followed by a day with gem foam. A few stones came out looking good, but others weren’t very shiny. The [[quartz]]-y ones polished best, while the dalmatian [[jasper]] was reduced to tiny bits. I also noticed that some rocks seemed to have grit left stuck in pits or cracks.

*The final results — [[quartz|quartzes]] polished the best, while the dalmatian [[jasper]] crumbled into small pieces.*  

Overall, the batch was mixed but educational. I learned that it’s important to evaluate each rock individually and move them through stages at their own pace. Having a second tumbler might even help keep batches separated. I also realized that burnishing with borax or soap between stages could improve results. It seems like most people like to use flakes of Ivory soap. I used detergent the first time, but I will try borax or Ivory next time.

For my next batch, I picked up a National Geographic [refill kit](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07H7WFWYT) and plan to start in the next few days. I also bought a set of really cool-looking rough stones ([link](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07VZDCPQG)), but I’m saving those for later, once I have more experience. To improve things, I ordered [ceramic filler media](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DFWYF6JT), more grit from National Geographic ([link](https://www.amazon.ca/National-Geographic-Tumbler-Polish-Refill/dp/B0DTWQGB91/ref=sr15)), and I’ll eventually try the [Polly Plastics grit kit](https://www.amazon.ca/Polly-Plastics-Tumbler-Tumbling-Resealable/dp/B01MTEB7SA/ref=sr14), which many people recommend.

I also saw on some Facebook groups and a sub-Reddit that many Canadian rockhounds who like to tumble their rocks buy their tumblers and vibratory tumblers from Princess Auto. I will have to look into that at some point. 

This first batch wasn’t perfect, but that’s okay — it gave me a chance to learn the process and see what works. Each rock is different, and that’s part of what makes tumbling so interesting. I’m looking forward to experimenting with the next batch and seeing how much better the results can get. There's also nothing to stop me from putting rocks that didn't turn out the way I wanted back in the tumbler.
