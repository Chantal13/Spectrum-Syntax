## My First Rock Tumbling Batch

I decided to try rock tumbling after stumbling across some National Geographic kits online. As a kid, I was always drawn to rocks and shells — especially ones I could crack open in search of fossils — but I never really thought about collecting stones to polish. Seeing those kits reminded me how much I enjoy science and nature, and the idea of taking something billions of years old and giving it new life by polishing it felt fascinating.

My goal with tumbling is to learn more about rockhounding and identifying rocks and minerals. I want to understand the process well enough to get the best results I can. And once I find some pieces I really love, I’d like to turn them into jewellery for myself, friends, and family.

For equipment, I used the [National Geographic Professional Rock Tumbler](https://www.amazon.ca/NATIONAL-GEOGRAPHIC-Professional-Rock-Tumbler/dp/B086Z83SV5/ref=sr17). It came with a four-stage grit kit and some starter stones. I didn’t use any filler media, which turned out to be a mistake — a few of the Dalmatian Jasper pieces cracked into tiny fragments because the barrel wasn’t full enough.

The coarse stage ran twice, about five days each time. Looking back, I should have removed the smoother rocks after the first round instead of tumbling everything again. By the medium and fine stages, I still wasn’t sure what I should be looking for in terms of surface quality, so some rocks moved forward before they were ready. For polishing, I used the kit’s stage 4 polish and finished with a short soap cycle followed by a day with gem foam. A few stones came out looking good, but others weren’t very shiny. The crystals polished best, while the Dalmatian Jasper was reduced to tiny bits. I think there is also grit leftover in some of the stones.

Overall, the batch was mixed but educational. I learned that it’s important to evaluate each rock individually and move them through stages at their own pace. Having a second tumbler might even help keep batches separated. I also realized that burnishing with borax or soap between stages could improve results.

For my next batch, I picked up a National Geographic [refill kit](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07H7WFWYT) and plan to start in the next few days. I also bought a set of really striking rough stones ([link](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07VZDCPQG)), but I’m saving those for later, once I have more experience. To improve things, I ordered [ceramic filler media](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DFWYF6JT), more grit from National Geographic ([link](https://www.amazon.ca/National-Geographic-Tumbler-Polish-Refill/dp/B0DTWQGB91/ref=sr15)), and I’ll eventually try the [Polly Plastics grit kit](https://www.amazon.ca/Polly-Plastics-Tumbler-Tumbling-Resealable/dp/B01MTEB7SA/ref=sr14), which many people recommend.

This first batch wasn’t perfect, but that’s okay — it gave me a chance to learn the process and see what works. Each rock is different, and that’s part of what makes tumbling so interesting. I’m looking forward to experimenting with the next batch and seeing how much better the results can get. There's also nothing to stop me from putting rocks that didn't turn out the way I wanted back in the tumbler.
