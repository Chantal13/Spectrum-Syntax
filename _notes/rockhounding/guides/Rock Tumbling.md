## Rocks & Minerals to Collect

### Igneous Rocks
- [[granite]] → Speckled rock of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], and mica. Polishes well in smaller-grained pieces.  
- [[basalt]] → Dark, fine-grained volcanic rock. Often dull after tumbling but smooth.  
- [[feldspar]] → Found within [[granite]] and [[unakite]]. Pink, white, or green crystals can take a satin polish.  
- [[quartz]] → Grey, white, or translucent. A classic tumbling stone with excellent shine.  

### Metamorphic Rocks
- [[gneiss]] → Banded cousin of [[granite]]. Tumbling can highlight its wavy layers.  
- [[unakite]] → A mix of green epidote, pink [[feldspar]], and [[quartz]]. One of the most striking Lake Ontario tumbling stones.  
- [[epidote]] → Green mineral usually seen within [[unakite]]. Satin polish with rich colour.  
- [[marble]] → Crystalline metamorphosed limestone. Softer ([[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 3), so requires special care.  

### Sedimentary Rocks
- [[conglomerate]] → Pebble-rich stone with [[quartz]] and other clasts. Polishes into unique patterned stones.  
- [[breccia]] → Similar to conglomerate but with sharp, angular fragments.  
- [[Sandstone]] → Often too soft for tumbling, but [[quartz]]-rich varieties can smooth nicely.  
- [[Petrified Wood]] (rare) → Ancient fossilized wood replaced with silica. Can polish beautifully if found.  

### Microcrystalline [[quartz]] Varieties
- [[agate]] → Banded, translucent [[quartz]]. Rare but possible along Lake Ontario. Excellent polish.  
- [[jasper]] → Opaque red, brown, or yellow [[quartz]]. Durable and great for tumbling.  
- [[Chert / Flint]] → Hard, smooth cryptocrystalline [[quartz]], often grey or brown. Takes a glossy finish.

## Equipment for Rock Tumbling
- **Basic Tools:** Bucket, sieve, gloves, and sturdy shoes for shoreline hunting.  
- **Tumbler Setup:** Rotary or vibratory tumbler, grit stages (coarse, medium, fine, polish).  
- **Additional Supplies:** Plastic pellets for cushioning softer stones, dedicated polish for [[quartz]]-based rocks.  

> **Rock Size**  
> Collect stones between **1–5 cm (½ inch to 2 inches)** for best tumbling results. Avoid heavily fractured pieces.

## Tumbling Tips
1. **Sort by Hardness** → Don’t tumble soft marble with hard [[quartz]]. Keep similar hardnesses together.  
2. **Use Stages Properly** → Each grit stage (coarse, medium, fine, polish) should run for at least a week.  
3. **Check Frequently** → Remove cracked or undercut stones before advancing stages.  
4. **Finish Strong** → [[quartz]], [[jasper]], and [[agate]] will take a glass-like polish. [[feldspar]]-rich rocks (like [[granite]]) may have a softer sheen.
