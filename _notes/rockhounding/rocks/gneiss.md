Gneiss (pronounced “nice”) is a **[[metamorphic]] rock** characterized by its distinctive light-and-dark banding. It forms when pre-existing rocks such as [[granite]], sandstone, or shale are subjected to intense heat and pressure, causing the minerals to re-crystallize and separate into layers.  

On the north shores of Lake Ontario, gneiss is most commonly found as **glacial erratics** — stones carried south from the ancient Canadian Shield by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Today, they can be found as rounded pebbles and cobbles scattered along the beaches.

## Appearance & Identification
- **Texture:** Banded, striped, or layered  
- **Minerals:** [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], mica, amphibole  
- **Colors:** Grey, white, black, with occasional pink or green tones  
- **Special Feature:** Some gneisses contain red **[[garnet]] crystals**, which stand out as small, rounded inclusions  

> [!tip] Field ID Tip  
> Look for a rock with a “striped” or “zebra” pattern. If it looks like [[granite]] but with parallel bands, it’s probably gneiss.

## Tumbling Qualities
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7  
- **[[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] Notes:**  
  - Polishes fairly well, though banding can sometimes undercut slightly.  
  - [[garnet]]-bearing gneiss produces especially attractive results.  
- **Best Use:** Decorative polished stones, display pieces, or cabochons.  

> [!warning] Not all gneiss is suitable for [[Rock Tumbling|tumbling]]. Avoid crumbly specimens, as softer mica-rich layers may break down in the tumbler.

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** Most gneiss found along Lake Ontario was transported from the **Canadian Shield**, one of the world’s oldest geological formations.  
- **How It Arrived:** Carried by glaciers during the Ice Age, deposited as till, and later exposed by erosion.  
- **Where to Find:** Common along gravelly beaches, especially near creek mouths and outflows like the Rouge River and Don Valley.

## Rock Family
Gneiss belongs to the **[[metamorphic]] Rock family**, formed through the transformation of pre-existing rocks under heat and pressure.
