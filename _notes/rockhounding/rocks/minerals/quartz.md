**Appearance & Identification:**  
- Milky quartz: opaque white  
- Smoky quartz: translucent grey-brown  
- Chalcedony: waxy and semi-translucent  
- Hardness test: scratches glass

> [!info] Fun fact:  
> Quartz appears in **all three rock families** — [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]] — which is why it’s so common.
