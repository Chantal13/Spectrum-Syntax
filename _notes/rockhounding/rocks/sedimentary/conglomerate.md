Conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock of rounded pebbles and cobbles set in a finer matrix; the rounded clasts record transport by water. “Puddingstone” is a colorful variety.

One of the most famous varieties is **puddingstone**, a type of conglomerate that contains bright red [[jasper]] pebbles within a lighter [[quartz]] or sand matrix. Glaciers have scattered puddingstone and other conglomerates across Southern Ontario, and they can sometimes be found along the **north shores of Lake Ontario** as glacial erratics.
