Conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock of rounded pebbles and cobbles set in a finer matrix; the rounded clasts record transport by water. “Puddingstone” is a colorful variety.

One of the most famous varieties is **puddingstone**, a type of conglomerate that contains bright red [[jasper]] pebbles within a lighter [[quartz]] or sand matrix. Glaciers have scattered puddingstone and other conglomerates across Southern Ontario, and they can sometimes be found along the **north shores of Lake Ontario** as glacial erratics.

## Appearance & Identification
- **Texture:** Coarse-grained; rounded pebbles embedded in a finer-grained matrix  
- **Clast size:** Pebbles or cobbles larger than 2 mm, well-rounded  
- **Colours:** Highly variable, depending on clast composition  
  - Red, green, brown, or grey pebbles  
  - Lighter-coloured matrix (white, tan, beige)  
- **Field ID Tip:** Looks like a “stone fruitcake” or “pudding,” which is why some varieties are called puddingstone  

> [!tip] Field Collecting  
> Conglomerates are easiest to spot when wet — the polished pebbles stand out against the duller matrix.

## [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] Qualities
- **Hardness:** Varies depending on clasts (typically [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7 if [[quartz]]- or [[jasper]]-rich)  
- **Polishing Notes:**  
  - Clasts and matrix may polish unevenly because they have different hardnesses.  
  - Best to choose dense, well-cemented pieces.  
  - Can yield beautiful, speckled stones that highlight red [[jasper]] or [[quartz]] inclusions.  
- **Lapidary Use:** Often cut and polished for display pieces, slabs, and jewelry.  

> [!warning] Not all conglomerates are tumbler-friendly. If the cement is soft, the rock may crumble in the barrel. Stick to solid, well-bound specimens.

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** Formed in ancient riverbeds or shorelines where rounded pebbles were cemented together.  
- **Transport:** Glaciers carried conglomerates, including puddingstone, from northern Ontario and beyond during the last Ice Age.  
- **Where to Find:**  
  - Beaches with mixed glacial gravels along **Scarborough Bluffs** and **Toronto’s waterfront**  
  - Ravine mouths (Rouge River, Don Valley)  
  - Pebble-rich stretches of Durham Region (Lynde Shores, Darlington, Pickering)

## Rock Family
Conglomerate belongs to the **Sedimentary Rock family**. It is closely related to:  
- **Sandstone** → finer-grained, made of sand-sized particles  
- **[[breccia]]** → similar to conglomerate but with angular, not rounded, clasts

## Related Stones
- **[[jasper]]** → Often occurs as clasts inside puddingstone  
- **[[quartz]]** → Common pebble within conglomerates  
- **[[breccia]]** → The angular cousin of conglomerate
