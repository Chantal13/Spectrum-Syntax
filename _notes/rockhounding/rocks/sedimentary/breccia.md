Breccia is a clastic rock made of angular fragments cemented by finer material; the sharp clasts indicate little transport between breakage and deposition.

On the north shores of Lake Ontario, breccia can occasionally be found in glacial gravels and erratics. Though less common than [[conglomerate]], it’s still worth keeping an eye out for these “jagged puzzle rocks.”
