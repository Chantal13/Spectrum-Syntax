Breccia is a clastic rock made of angular fragments cemented by finer material; the sharp clasts indicate little transport between breakage and deposition.

On the north shores of Lake Ontario, breccia can occasionally be found in glacial gravels and erratics. Though less common than [[conglomerate]], it’s still worth keeping an eye out for these “jagged puzzle rocks.”

## Appearance & Identification
- **Texture:** Angular rock fragments embedded in a fine matrix  
- **Clast Shape:** Sharp, broken edges (unlike rounded conglomerates)  
- **Colors:** Highly variable — clasts may be red, green, grey, or brown  
- **Field ID Tip:** If the fragments look freshly broken and fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, you’ve probably found breccia  

> [!tip] Field Collecting  
> Check the edges of clasts: if they’re jagged instead of smooth, you’re looking at breccia.

## [[Rock Tumbling|Tumbling]] Qualities
- **Hardness:** Varies depending on clast composition and cement  
- **Polishing Notes:**  
  - Like [[conglomerate]], breccia may polish unevenly because clasts and cement differ in hardness.  
  - Best results come from dense, silica-cemented specimens.  
  - Polished breccia reveals dramatic contrast between fragments and matrix.  
- **Lapidary Use:** Often cut into slabs or cabochons for decorative use.  

> [!warning] Avoid breccia with soft cement — it may crumble in a tumbler.

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** Formed in areas of faulting, landslides, or volcanic activity where rocks fracture and are quickly cemented together.  
- **Transport:** Glaciers carried breccia erratics into Southern Ontario during the Ice Age.  
- **Where to Find:**  
  - Less common than [[conglomerate]], but may appear in mixed gravels along Toronto’s beaches  
  - Possible in Durham Region beaches (Lynde Shores, Darlington) after storms

## Rock Family
Breccia belongs to the **Sedimentary Rock family**, though some types are **volcanic breccias** formed from explosive eruptions.  

It is closely related to:  
- **Conglomerate** → made of rounded clasts, transported farther by water  
- **Tuff** → a volcanic rock formed of ash and angular fragments

## Related Stones
- **Conglomerate ([[conglomerate|Puddingstone]])** → Rounded pebbles instead of angular fragments  
- **[[jasper]]** → Can appear as clasts in breccia  
- **[[quartz]]** → Common in both breccia and [[conglomerate]]
