Granite is a coarse-grained **[[igneous]] rock** composed mainly of **[[quartz]], [[feldspar]], and mica**. It forms when magma cools slowly beneath the Earth’s surface, giving its crystals time to grow large and visible.  

Along the north shores of Lake Ontario, granite is common in glacial erratics — stones carried south from the Canadian Shield during the last Ice Age. These rounded granite pebbles are durable, colorful, and often used in [[Rock Tumbling]].

## Appearance & Identification
- **Texture:** Coarse-grained, interlocking crystals  
- **Color:** Pink, white, or grey background ([[feldspar]] + [[quartz]]) with black specks (mica, hornblende)  
- **Minerals:**  
  - Pink or white → [[feldspar]]  
  - Glassy grey → [[quartz]]  
  - Black flakes → Biotite or hornblende  
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7 (depends on [[quartz]] content)  

> [!tip] Field ID  
> If you see a speckled rock with pink/white and black crystals, it’s probably granite.

## Tumbling Qualities
- **Hardness:** [[Mohs Hardness Scale|Mohs]] 6–7  
- **Polishing Notes:**  
  - Granite can polish, but softer [[feldspar]] and mica may undercut compared to [[quartz]].  
  - Best results with small, dense, fine-grained granite.  
  - Produces a speckled, glossy finish when successful.  

> [!warning] Large-grained granite doesn’t tumble evenly — [[feldspar]] and mica may pit while [[quartz]] stays glossy.

## Connection to Lake Ontario
- **Origin:** From the ancient Canadian Shield (over 1 billion years old).  
- **Transport:** Glaciers carried granite boulders and cobbles south into Southern Ontario.  
- **Where to Find:**  
  - Beaches near Scarborough Bluffs, Rouge River, Cherry Beach  
  - Durham Region beaches (Lynde Shores, Darlington, Pickering)

## Rock Family
Granite belongs to the **[[igneous]] Rock family** (intrusive type).
