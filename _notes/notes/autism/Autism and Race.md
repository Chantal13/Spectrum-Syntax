# Autism and Race: Why Racialized Autistic People Are Missed, Misdiagnosed, and Harmed

Autism does not exist outside of social systems. For racialized people, autism is experienced through **racism, surveillance, and unequal access to care**. This article explains why racialized autistic people are more likely to be missed, misdiagnosed, or punished—and why an intersectional approach is essential.

## Autism Is Not Diagnosed Equally

Start with the evidence: prevalence is stable, but diagnosis is not.[^1]

Autism prevalence does not differ meaningfully by race. Diagnosis does.

Racialized children—especially Black children—are:
- Diagnosed later
- Less likely to receive autism diagnoses
- More likely to receive behavioural or conduct-based diagnoses
- More likely to be disciplined rather than supported

These differences reflect **systemic bias**, not differences in behaviour.

---

## Behaviour Is Interpreted Through Race

Racism shapes how the same traits are perceived and labeled.[^1]

Identical behaviours are read differently depending on race:
- Emotional dysregulation may be labeled “distress” in white children
- The same behaviour may be labeled “defiance” or “aggression” in Black children

This racialized interpretation transforms neurodivergence into misconduct.

## Adultification and Loss of Protection

When childhood is denied, support turns into punishment.[^1]

Black children are frequently perceived as older and less innocent. When childhood itself is denied:
- Developmental differences are punished
- Support is withheld
- Neurodivergence is criminalized

Autistic traits become safety risks rather than support needs.

## The Cost of Masking for Safety

Survival often requires a level of masking that takes a heavy toll.[^1]

Racialized autistic people often mask not just to fit in—but to stay safe.

This leads to:
- Hyper-vigilance
- Chronic stress
- Burnout
- Delayed or missed diagnosis
- Increased mental health risk

[[Masking]] becomes survival, not adaptation.

## Neurodiversity Without Anti-Racism Is Incomplete

Without an anti-racist lens, neurodiversity remains selective.[^1]

Mainstream neurodiversity narratives have often centered white autistic experiences.

Without anti-racist frameworks:
- Some autistic people are protected by “quirky genius” narratives
- Racialized autistic people remain surveilled and punished
- Neurodivergence is unevenly humanized

Autism must be understood **intersectionally**, or inequity persists.

---

## What an Anti-Racist Autism Framework Requires

Equity requires structural change, not just awareness.[^1]

- Equitable diagnostic access
- Culturally informed assessment
- Rejection of behavioural moralism
- Reduction of surveillance-based discipline
- Centering racialized autistic voices
- Support over punishment at every level

---

## Key Takeaway

Autism does not look different in racialized people.  
**Systems respond differently to it.**

Until racism is addressed alongside ableism, racialized autistic people will continue to be overlooked, misdiagnosed, and harmed.
