Autistic burnout is a state of pervasive exhaustion and reduced functioning caused by prolonged demands exceeding autistic capacity over time.[^1] It often includes sensory overload, loss of skills, and diminished ability to mask.

For workplace-focused guidance on prevention and manager support, see [[Neurodivergence at Work]].

## Core Characteristics

These are the most commonly reported and observable changes.[^1]

- Pervasive exhaustion (not relieved by rest)
- Increased sensory sensitivity
- Executive function decline
- Reduced speech or communication access
- Heightened reliance on routines
- More visible autistic traits

---

## Common Contributors

Burnout usually reflects prolonged mismatch between demands and supports.[^1]

- Chronic [[Masking]]
- Lack of accommodations
- [[Internalized Ableism]]
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Prolonged stress or overcapacity living
- Co-occurring physical or mental health conditions

---

## Burnout vs Depression

Both can coexist, but the core experience differs in important ways.[^2]

**Burnout**
- Exhaustion-focused
- Relief imagined through rest or reduced demands
- Pleasure still accessible when energy allows

**Depression**
- Loss of pleasure (anhedonia)
- Hopelessness about self and future
- Worthlessness narratives
- Suicidal ideation more likely

Often co-occurring; both require support.

## Recovery Principles

Recovery focuses on reducing load and rebuilding sustainable routines.[^1]

- Energy pacing systems (spoons, tickets, energy accounting)
- Dropping non-essential demands
- Self-accommodations
- Micro-rest and sensory regulation
- Grieving limits and addressing [[Internalized Ableism]]
- Medical evaluation for long-term fatigue

## Autistic Burnout Checklist

### Early Warning Signs
- ☐ Persistent exhaustion (mental, physical, emotional)
- ☐ Increased sensory sensitivity (noise, light, touch, food)
- ☐ Loss of skills (executive function, speech, organization)
- ☐ Greater reliance on routines or repetition
- ☐ Reduced ability to mask or “hold it together”
- ☐ More frequent shutdowns or meltdowns
- ☐ Difficulty with daily living tasks (showering, eating, transitions)

### Questions to Ask Yourself
- ☐ Am I operating beyond my real capacity most days?
- ☐ Have I been [[Masking]] heavily or suppressing self-regulation?
- ☐ Am I ignoring early warning signs because of expectations or guilt?
- ☐ Do rest and time off *actually* restore me?

### Burnout vs Depression Check
- ☐ Can I still feel pleasure when I access my interests?  
  - Yes → burnout more likely  
  - No → depression may also be present
- ☐ Do my thoughts centre on exhaustion and wanting demands to stop (burnout) or hopelessness and worthlessness (depression)?

### Immediate Supports
- ☐ Reduce sensory input where possible
- ☐ Drop non-essential tasks
- ☐ Use text instead of speech if needed
- ☐ Add micro-rest throughout the day
- ☐ Ask for help or accommodations early
