summary: Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental difference that shapes how people process, communicate, and navigate the world. It is not a character flaw or a lack of empathy, and disability increases when environments are rigid or inaccessible. This page focuses on masking, late diagnosis, and how bias and social context shape recognition and support.
