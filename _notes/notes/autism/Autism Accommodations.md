These accommodations are **low-cost, practical, and flexible**. Not every autistic person will need all of them—accommodations should always be **individualized**.

---

## Key Principle

The most effective accommodation is often:
> **Reducing unnecessary demands rather than adding coping strategies.**

Many frameworks describe these supports as “reasonable adjustments” or a “[[Duty to Accommodate - Canada|duty to accommodate]].”[^1][^2]

Accommodations work best when they are:
- Proactive
- Trust-based
- Adjusted over time
- Supported by management and coworkers

---

## Communication Accommodations

Clear communication reduces ambiguity and cognitive load, which makes other supports more effective.

- Written instructions or follow-ups after meetings
- Agendas shared in advance of meetings
- Permission to respond in writing instead of verbally
- Clear, direct language (avoid vague expectations)
- One point of contact instead of multiple, conflicting requests
- Extra processing time before responding to questions

---

## Workload & Task Management

Once communication is clear, workload structure determines how sustainable the work actually is.

- Clear prioritization of tasks (what is urgent vs. what can wait)
- Reduced multitasking; fewer simultaneous deadlines
- Breaking large tasks into smaller, defined steps
- Advance notice of changes to priorities or scope
- Temporary reduction in workload during burnout periods
- Protection from being assigned “extra” work because someone is capable

---

## Scheduling & Time

Time flexibility prevents avoidable overload and supports consistent performance.

- Flexible start and end times
- Modified hours or reduced hours (temporary or ongoing)
- Remote or hybrid work options
- Fewer or shorter meetings
- Ability to decline non-essential meetings
- Predictable schedules with minimal last-minute changes

---

## Sensory Environment

Regulating sensory input keeps attention and energy available for the task itself.

- Quiet workspace or private office
- Noise-cancelling headphones or ear protection
- Control over lighting (lamp instead of overhead lights)
- Permission to wear sensory-supportive clothing
- Reduced exposure to high-traffic or noisy areas
- Option to keep camera off in virtual meetings

---

## Regulation & Self-Management

Self-regulation supports focus, recovery, and nervous system stability.

- Permission to stim or move without judgment
- Flexible break schedules (including short, frequent breaks)
- Access to a quiet or low-stimulation space
- Ability to step away briefly during overload without penalty
- Use of assistive tools (timers, planners, task managers)

---

## Performance & Expectations

Clear expectations reduce performance anxiety and misinterpretation.

- Outcome-focused evaluation rather than style-based evaluation
- Adjusted productivity expectations during recovery periods
- Clear, written performance standards
- Reduced emphasis on social performance (e.g., “team presence”)
- Recognition that capacity may fluctuate

---

## Disclosure & Process

A fair process protects privacy while getting accommodations in place.

- No requirement to disclose diagnosis to receive basic accommodations
- Respect for privacy—no pressure to explain medical details
- Fast, informal accommodations while formal processes run
- Union or support person allowed in accommodation discussions
- Periodic review and adjustment of accommodations

---

## Canadian Jurisdiction Notes

Which law applies depends on whether a workplace is federally or provincially regulated.

- Federal (Canada): The Canadian Human Rights Act applies to the federal government and federally regulated private-sector employers.[^3] Federally regulated industries include banks, telecommunications, broadcasting, airlines, railways, interprovincial trucking, shipping, and ports.[^4]
- Ontario: The Ontario Human Rights Code applies to provincially regulated workplaces in Ontario (most employers), with claims adjudicated by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario.[^5][^6]
- Other provinces: British Columbia uses the BC Human Rights Code, and Quebec uses the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms; each province and territory has its own human rights commission or tribunal.[^7][^8]

## During Burnout or Recovery

When capacity drops, the goal is stabilization and sustainability.

- Temporary “low capacity mode” with reduced expectations
- Phased return to work after leave
- Protection from discipline related to burnout symptoms
- Flexibility to reassess accommodations as capacity changes
- Emphasis on sustainability, not “bouncing back”
