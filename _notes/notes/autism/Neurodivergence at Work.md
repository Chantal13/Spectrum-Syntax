# Neurodivergence at Work: Supportive Management for Autistic Colleagues  
*(For Managers, Supervisors, and Coworkers)*

> [!Purpose]
> This guide focuses on practical, low-cost ways to support autistic workers, reduce burnout risk, and build sustainable teams.  
> Support is not special treatment—it is removing barriers that should not have been there.

## Core Support Principles

- Reduce unnecessary demands before adding coping strategies
- Make expectations explicit, written, and prioritized
- Design for predictability and reduced sensory load
- Respect privacy; never require disclosure for basic supports
- Assume capacity can fluctuate and plan for flexibility

---

## Clear Communication

- Share agendas and goals ahead of meetings
- Follow up verbally delivered information in writing
- Ask one clear question at a time; avoid vague expectations
- Provide a single point of contact when possible
- Allow extra processing time before expecting a response

---

## Workload and Task Design

- Set explicit priorities and timelines
- Break large tasks into smaller, defined steps
- Reduce simultaneous deadlines and context switching
- Provide advance notice of changes to scope or priority
- Avoid assigning “extra” work because someone is capable

---

## Scheduling and Sensory Supports

- Offer flexible start/end times or remote/hybrid options
- Minimize last-minute schedule changes
- Reduce non-essential meetings
- Provide quiet workspaces, headphones, or lighting choices
- Allow camera-off participation in video calls

---

## Self-Regulation and Breaks

- Allow movement, stimming, and short breaks without stigma
- Support stepping away briefly during overload
- Encourage use of planners, timers, and task tools
- Focus on outcomes rather than social performance

---

## Recognizing Burnout Early

Autistic burnout is a **nervous-system overload state** caused by long-term demands that exceed capacity.[^1]

Early signs can include:
- Slower processing or response times
- Increased sensory sensitivity or shutdowns
- Loss of access to speech or written communication
- Greater reliance on routines
- Sudden drops in output after periods of high masking

---

## Supportive Responses When Capacity Drops

- Ask what reduces load *right now*
- Temporarily reduce output without penalty
- Shift to written communication if speech is difficult
- Reduce meetings and interruptions
- Treat accommodations as normal, not exceptional

---

## Race and Gender Matter

Autism is often missed or misinterpreted in racialized communities, and gendered expectations increase pressure to mask.[^3][^4]  
Supportive workplaces should:
- Assume bias can affect who is believed, accommodated, or disciplined
- Watch for uneven scrutiny or punitive responses
- Avoid “professionalism” rules that punish difference
- Make accommodations available without requiring proof or disclosure
