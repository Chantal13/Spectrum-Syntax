<p>See <a href="{{ '/notes/rockhounding/rocks/minerals/jasper-varieties/jasper-varieties/' | relative_url }}">Jasper Varieties</a> for specific types including banded jasper and picture jasper.</p>

Jasper is an opaque, iron‑bearing variety of microcrystalline [[quartz]] ([[chalcedony]]); its rich reds, browns, and patterns come from mineral impurities and layered silica deposition.
