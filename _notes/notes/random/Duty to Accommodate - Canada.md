This note summarizes the duty to accommodate, explains undue hardship, and lists Canadian examples where organizations were found to have failed to accommodate. It is a practical overview, not legal advice.

## What the Duty to Accommodate Means

The duty to accommodate requires organizations to adjust rules, practices, or environments to enable equal participation for people with disabilities, up to the point of undue hardship.[^1] In workplaces, this can include scheduling changes, modified tasks, flexible communication methods, sensory adjustments, or temporary changes during illness or disability-related flare-ups.

Health services have additional responsibilities. Regulated professionals are expected to provide services without discrimination and to make reasonable changes to their practices.[^2]

## What “Undue Hardship” Means

“Undue hardship” is the legal limit on accommodation. It is not about inconvenience or preference, but about significant, demonstrable burdens such as excessive cost or serious safety risks. The Ontario Human Rights Commission notes that organizations must show they actually explored options and cannot simply rely on generalized assertions.[^1]

In practice, undue hardship arguments often fail when an employer:
- Does not gather evidence about costs or risks
- Ignores lower-impact options
- Disregards medical information
- Treats accommodation as optional or temporary only

## Practical Takeaways for Managers and Providers

- Ask for the impact and the barrier, not personal details that are not required
- Document accommodation options considered and the evidence behind any refusals
- Treat accommodations as ongoing and revisitable, not one-time fixes
- Watch for bias in “professionalism” rules that penalize disability traits
- Involve the worker or service user in designing what will actually work
